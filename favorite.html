             <p class="tof-fave">She likes chicken, liver, fish, etc. Sometimes Toffee plays with her sister Tiger; they play around the house until they get tired and walk on to her mommy to pet her. She's a playful dog, and that's our baby. Toffee is our favorite of all time, toffee is important, toffee is loveable, and toffee is our stress reliever.
